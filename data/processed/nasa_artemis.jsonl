A veteran of two spaceflights, McArthur logged 213 days in space, including being the first woman to pilot a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft and the last person to “touch” the Hubble Space Telescope with the space shuttle’s robotic arm.\nMcArthur launched as pilot of NASA’s SpaceX Crew-2 mission in April 2021, marking her second spaceflight and her first long-duration stay aboard the International Space Station. During the 200-day mission, she served as a flight engineer for Expeditions 65/66, conducting a wide array of scientific experiments in human health, materials sciences, and robotics to advance exploration of the Moon under Artemis and prepare to send American astronauts to Mars.\nHer first spaceflight was STS-125 in 2009, aboard the space shuttle Atlantis, the fifth and final servicing mission to Hubble. As a mission specialist, she was responsible for capturing the telescope with the robotic arm, as well as supporting five spacewalks to update and repair Hubble after its first 19 years in space. She also played a key role in supporting shuttle operations during launch, rendezvous with the telescope, and landing.\n“Megan’s thoughtful leadership, operational excellence, and deep commitment to science and exploration have made a lasting impact,” said Steve Koerner, acting director of NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. “Her contributions have helped shape the future of human space exploration, and we are incredibly grateful for her service.”\nIn addition to her flight experience, McArthur has served in various technical and leadership roles within NASA. In 2019, she became the deputy division chief of the Astronaut Office, supporting astronaut training, development, and ongoing spaceflight operations. She also served as the assistant director of flight operations for the International Space Station Program starting in 2017.\nSince 2022, McArthur has served as the chief science officer at Space Center Houston, NASA Johnson’s official visitor center. Continuing in this role, she actively promotes public engagement with space exploration themes, aiming to increase understanding of the benefits to humanity and enhance science literacy.\n“Megan brought a unique combination of technical skill and compassion to everything she did,” said Joe Acaba, chief of the Astronaut Office at NASA Johnson. “Whether in space or on the ground, she embodied the best of what it means to be an astronaut and a teammate. Her contributions will be felt by the next generation of explorers she helped train.”\nMcArthur was born in Honolulu and raised as a “Navy kid” in many different locations worldwide. She earned a Bachelor of Science in aerospace engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles, and a doctorate in oceanography from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. Before being selected as an astronaut in 2000, she conducted oceanographic research focusing on underwater acoustics, which involved shipboard work and extensive scuba diving.\nMcArthur is married to former NASA astronaut Robert Behnken, who also flew aboard the Dragon Endeavour spacecraft during the agency’s SpaceX Demo-2 mission in 2020.\n“It was an incredible privilege to serve as a NASA astronaut, working with scientists from around the world on cutting-edge research that continues to have a lasting impact here on Earth and prepares humanity for future exploration at the Moon and Mars,” said McArthur. “From NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope to the International Space Station, our research lab in low Earth orbit, humanity has developed incredible tools that help us answer important scientific questions, solve complex engineering challenges, and gain a deeper understanding of our place in the universe. Seeing our beautiful planet from space makes it so clear how fragile and precious our home is, and how vital it is that we protect it. I am grateful I had the opportunity to contribute to this work, and I’m excited to watch our brilliant engineers and scientists at NASA conquer new challenges and pursue further scientific discoveries for the benefit of all.”\nTo learn more about NASA’s astronauts and their contributions to space exploration, visit:\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/astronauts\n-end-\nShaneequa Vereen\nJohnson Space Center, Houston\n281-483-5111\nshaneequa.y.vereen@nasa.gov"}

The two missions are targeting launch on the same rocket no earlier than Tuesday, Sept. 23.\nThe IMAP mission will map the boundaries of our heliosphere, the vast bubble created by the Sun’s wind that encapsulates our entire solar system. As a modern-day celestial cartographer, IMAP will explore how the heliosphere interacts with interstellar space, as well as chart the range of particles that fill the space between the planets. The IMAP mission also will support near real-time observations of the solar wind and energetic particles. These energetic particles can produce hazardous space weather that can impact spacecraft and other NASA hardware as the agency explores deeper into space, including at the Moon under the Artemis campaign.\nNASA’s Carruthers Geocorona Observatory will image the ultraviolet glow of Earth’s exosphere, the outermost region of our planet’s atmosphere. This data will help scientists understand how space weather from the Sun shapes the exosphere and ultimately impacts our planet. The first observation of this glow – called the geocorona – was captured during Apollo 16, when a telescope designed and built by George Carruthers was deployed on the Moon.\nAudio of the teleconference will stream live on the agency’s website at:\nParticipants include:\n- Nicky Fox, associate administrator, Science Mission Directorate, NASA Headquarters in Washington\n- Teresa Nieves-Chinchilla, director, Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office, NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland\n- David J.

However, with a growing focus on commercialization, NASA wants to further understand industry’s tracking capabilities.\nThis collaboration opportunity builds upon a previous request released by NASA’s SCaN (Space Communication and Navigation) Program during the Artemis I mission, where ten volunteers successfully tracked the uncrewed Orion spacecraft in 2022 on its journey thousands of miles beyond the Moon and back.\nDuring the Artemis I mission, participants – ranging from international space agencies, academic institutions, commercial companies, nonprofits, and private citizens – attempted to receive Orion’s signal and use their respective ground antennas to track and measure changes in the radio waves transmitted by Orion.\nThis data will help inform our transition to a commercial-first approach, ultimately strengthening the infrastructure needed to support long-term Moon to Mars objectives.\nKevin Coggins\nDeputy Associate Administrator for SCaN\n“By offering this opportunity to the broader aerospace community, we can identify available tracking capabilities outside the government,” said Kevin Coggins, NASA’s deputy associate administrator for SCaN at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “This data will help inform our transition to a commercial-first approach, ultimately strengthening the infrastructure needed to support Artemis missions and our long-term Moon to Mars objectives.”\nResponses are due by 5 p.m. EDT on Monday, Oct. 27.\nNASA’s SCaN Program serves as the management office for the agency’s space communications and navigation systems. More than 100 NASA and non-NASA missions rely on SCaN’s two networks, the Near Space Network and the Deep Space Network, to support astronauts aboard the International Space Station and future Artemis missions, monitor Earth’s weather, support lunar exploration, and uncover the solar system and beyond.\nArtemis II will help confirm the systems and hardware needed for human deep space exploration. This mission is the first crewed flight under NASA’s Artemis campaign and is another step toward new U.S.-crewed missions on the Moon’s surface that will help the agency prepare to send American astronauts to Mars."}

Teams directing operations from the ground include the mission management team, launch control team, flight control team, and the landing and recovery team, each with additional support personnel who are experts in every individual system and subsystem. The teams have managed every aspect of the test flight and ensure NASA is prepared to send humans beyond our atmosphere and into a new Golden Age of innovation and exploration.\nMission management team\nReviews of mission status and risk assessments are conducted by the mission management team, a group of 15 core members and additional advisors. Amit Kshatriya, NASA’s deputy associate administrator, Moon to Mars Program, will serve as the mission management team chair for the test flight.\nTwo days prior to launch, the mission management team will assemble to review mission risks and address any lingering preflight concerns. With more than 20 years of human spaceflight experience, Kshatriya will conduct polls at key decision points, providing direction for the relevant operations team. If circumstances during the flight go beyond established decision criteria or flight rules outlined ahead of the mission, the team will assess the situation based on the information available and decide how to respond.\nMatt Ramsey, serving as the Artemis II mission manager, will oversee all elements of mission preparedness prior to the mission management team assembly two days before launch and serve as deputy mission management team chair throughout the mission. With more than two decades of experience at NASA, Ramsey managed the SLS (Space Launch System) Engineering Support Center for Artemis I.\nLaunch control team\nThe launch control team coordinates launch operations from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Charlie Blackwell-Thompson serves as the agency’s Artemis launch director, responsible for integrating and coordinating launch operations for the SLS, Orion, and Exploration Ground Systems Programs, including developing and implementing plans for countdown, troubleshooting, and timing.\nTwo days before liftoff, when the countdown for launch begins, Blackwell-Thompson’s team will begin preparations for launch from their console positions in Firing Room 1 in Kennedy’s Launch Control Center. On the day of launch, Blackwell-Thompson and her team will manage countdown progress, propellent loading, and launch commit criteria. The criteria include standards for systems involved in launch, and the team will monitor the rocket until it lifts off from the launchpad.\nFlight control team\nFrom solid rocket booster ignition until the crew is safely extracted from the Orion capsule following splashdown in the Pacific Ocean at the end of their mission, the flight control team oversees operations from the Mission Control Center at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. Multiple flight directors will take turns leading the team throughout the 10-day mission to support operations around the clock. Jeff Radigan, bringing more than 20 years of International Space Station experience to Artemis II, will serve as lead flight director for the mission. The work for this role begins well in advance of the mission with building mission timelines; developing flight rules and procedures; leading the flight control team through simulations that prepare them for the flight test; and then helping them carry out the plan.\nOn launch day, the ascent flight control team will be led by Judd Frieling, an Artemis I flight director who also supported more than 20 shuttle missions as a flight controller. Frieling is responsible for overseeing the crew’s ascent to space, including performance of SLS core stage engines, solid rocket boosters, and propulsion systems from the moment of launch until the separation of Orion from the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage. As Orion is propelled toward the Moon, guidance of operations will pass to the next flight director.\nAt the opposite end of the mission, Rick Henfling will take the lead for Orion’s return to Earth and splashdown. Orion will reenter Earth’s atmosphere at roughly 25,000 mph to about 20 mph for a parachute-assisted splashdown. Drawing from a background supporting space shuttle ascent, entry, and abort operations and 10 years as a space station flight director, Henfling and the team will monitor weather forecasts for landing, watch over Orion’s systems through the dynamic entry phase, and to ensure the spacecraft is safely shutdown before handing over operations to the recovery team.\nAt any point during the mission, a single voice will speak to the crew in space on behalf of all members of the flight control team: the capsule communicator, or CapCom. The CapCom ensures the crew in space receives clear and concise communication from the teams supporting them on the ground. NASA astronaut Stan Love will serve as the lead CapCom for Artemis II. Love flew aboard STS-122 mission and has acted as CapCom for more than a dozen space station expeditions. He is also part of the astronaut office’s Rapid Prototyping Lab, which played a key role in development of Orion’s displays and controls.\nLanding, recovery team\nRetrieval of the crew and Orion crew module will be in the hands of the landing and recovery team, led by Lili Villarreal. The team will depart San Diego on a Department of Defense ship, and head to the vicinity of the landing site several days before splashdown for final preparations alongside the U.S. Navy and DOD.\nThe recovery team is made up of personnel operating from the ship, land, and air to recover both astronauts and the capsule. Decision-making authority during the recovery phase of mission operations belongs to Villarreal, who served as deputy flow director for Artemis I and worked in the operations division for the space station.\nThe success of Artemis II will pave the way for the next phase of the agency’s campaign, landing on the lunar South Pole region on Artemis III. These teams, along with the four crew members and countless NASA engineers, scientists, and personnel, are driving humanity’s exploration on the Moon, Mars, and beyond."}

They’ll be operating from a new space in the mission control complex built to host the Orion Mission Evaluation Room (MER). Through the success of Orion and the Artemis missions, NASA will return humanity to the Moon and prepare to land an American on the surface of Mars.\nInside the Mission Evaluation Room, dozens of engineers will be monitoring the spacecraft and collecting data, while the flight control team located in mission control’s White Flight Control Room is simultaneously operating and sending commands to Orion during the flight. The flight control team will rely on the engineering expertise of the evaluation room to help with unexpected spacecraft behaviors that may arise during the mission and help analyze Orion’s performance data.\nThe Mission Evaluation Room team is made up of engineers from NASA, Lockheed Martin, ESA (European Space Agency), and Airbus who bring deep, expert knowledge of the spacecraft’s subsystems and functions to the mission. These functions are represented across 24 consoles, usually staffed by two engineers in their respective discipline, often hosting additional support personnel during planned dynamic phases of the mission or test objectives.\n“The operations team is flying the spacecraft, but they are relying on the Mission Evaluation Room’s reachback engineering capability from the NASA, industry, and international Orion team that has designed, built, and tested this spacecraft.”\nTrey PerrymAn\nLead for Orion Mission and Integration Systems at NASA Johnson\nPerryman guides the Artemis II Orion Mission Evaluation Room alongside Jen Madsen, deputy manager for Orion’s Avionics, Power, and Software.\nWith crew aboard, Orion will put more systems to the test, requiring more expertise to monitor new systems not previously flown. To support these needs, and safe, successful flights of Orion to the Moon, NASA officially opened the all-new facility in mission control to host the Orion Mission Evaluation Room on Aug. 15.\nDuring Artemis II, the evaluation room will operate in three daily shifts, beginning about 48 hours prior to liftoff. The room is staffed around the clock throughout the nearly 10-day mission, up until the spacecraft has been safely secured inside the U.S. Navy ship that will recover it after splashdown.\nAnother key function of the evaluation room is collecting and analyzing the large amount of data Orion will produce during the flight, which will help inform the room’s team on the spacecraft’s performance.\n“Data collection is hugely significant,” Perryman said. “We’ll do an analysis and assessment of all the data we’ve collected, and compare it against what we were expecting from the spacecraft. While a lot of that data comparison will take place during the mission, we’ll also do deeper analysis after the mission is over to see what we learned.”\nIf unplanned situations arise during the mission, the Mission Evaluation Room has additional layers of ability to support any specific need that presents itself. This includes various engineering support from different NASA centers, Lockheed Martin’s Integrated Test Lab, ESA’s European Space Research and Technology Center, and more.\n“It’s been amazing to have helped design and build Orion from the beginning – and now, we’ll be able to see the culmination of all those years of work in this new Mission Evaluation Room.\"\nJen Madsen\nDeputy Manager for Orion’s Avionics, Power, and Software\n“We’ll see our spacecraft carrying our crew to the Moon on these screens and still be continuously learning about all of its capabilities,” said Madsen.\nThe Artemis II test flight will send NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, and Christina Koch, and CSA (Canadian Space Agency) astronaut Jeremy Hansen around the Moon and return them safely back home. This first crewed flight under NASA’s Artemis campaign will set the stage for NASA to return Americans to the lunar surface and help the agency and its commercial and international partners prepare for future human missions to Mars."}

Esta misión y sus dos compañeros de viaje orbitarán el Sol cerca del punto de Lagrange 1, a aproximadamente 1,6 millones de kilómetros (un millón de millas) de la Tierra, donde escaneará la heliosfera, analizará la composición de partículas cargadas e investigará cómo esas partículas se mueven a través del sistema solar. Esto proporcionará información sobre cómo el Sol acelera las partículas cargadas, aportando información esencial para comprender el entorno meteorológico espacial en todo el sistema solar. IMAP también monitoreará continuamente el viento solar y la radiación cósmica. La comunidad científica podrá usar estos datos para evaluar capacidades nuevas y mejoradas para herramientas y modelos de predicción de la meteorología espacial, que son vitales para la salud de los humanos que exploran el espacio y la longevidad de sistemas tecnológicos, como satélites y redes eléctricas, que pueden afectar la vida en la Tierra.\nEl Observatorio Carruthers de la Geocorona de la agencia es un pequeño satélite concebido para estudiar la exosfera, la parte más externa de la atmósfera de la Tierra. Utilizando cámaras ultravioletas, monitoreará cómo la meteorología espacial del Sol impacta la exosfera, la cual juega un papel crucial en la protección de la Tierra contra eventos de meteorología espacial que pueden afectar satélites, comunicaciones y líneas eléctricas. La exosfera, una nube de hidrógeno neutro que se extiende hasta la Luna y posiblemente más allá, se crea por la descomposición del agua y el metano por la luz ultravioleta del Sol, y su brillo, conocido como la geocorona, solo se ha observado a nivel mundial cuatro veces antes de esta misión.\nLa misión SWFO-L1, gestionada por la NOAA y desarrollada con el Centro de Vuelo Espacial Goddard de NASA en Greenbelt, Maryland, y socios comerciales, utilizará un conjunto de instrumentos para proporcionar mediciones en tiempo real del viento solar, junto con un coronógrafo compacto para detectar eyecciones de masa coronal del Sol. El observatorio, que sirve como baliza de alerta temprana para fenómenos meteorológicos espaciales potencialmente destructivos, permitirá pronósticos más rápidos y precisos. Sus datos, disponibles las 24 horas del día, los 7 días de la semana, ayudarán al Centro de Predicción Meteorológica Espacial de la NOAA a proteger infraestructuras vitales, intereses económicos y la seguridad nacional, tanto en la Tierra como en el espacio.\nDavid McComas, profesor de la Universidad de Princeton, lidera la misión IMAP con un equipo internacional de 25 instituciones asociadas.

This mission and its two rideshares will orbit the Sun near Lagrange point 1, about one million miles from Earth, where it will scan the heliosphere, analyze the composition of charged particles, and investigate how those particles move through the solar system. This will provide information on how the Sun accelerates charged particles, filling in essential puzzle pieces to understand the space weather environment across the solar system. The IMAP spacecraft also will continuously monitor solar wind and cosmic radiation. Scientists can use this information to evaluate new and improved capabilities for space weather prediction tools and models, which are vital for the health of human space explorers and the longevity of technological systems, like satellites and power grids, that can affect life on Earth.\nThe agency’s Carruthers Geocorona Observatory is a small satellite set to study the exosphere, the outermost part of Earth’s atmosphere. Using ultraviolet cameras, it will monitor how space weather from the Sun impacts the exosphere, which plays a crucial role in protecting Earth from space weather events that can affect satellites, communications, and power lines. The exosphere, a cloud of neutral hydrogen extending to the Moon and possibly beyond, is created by the breakdown of water and methane by ultraviolet light from the Sun, and its glow, known as the geocorona, has been observed globally only four times before this mission.\nThe SWFO-L1 mission, managed by NOAA and developed with NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and commercial partners, will use a suite of instruments to provide real-time measurements of solar wind, along with a compact coronagraph to detect coronal mass ejections from the Sun. The observatory, serving as an early warning beacon for potentially destructive space weather events, will enable faster and more accurate forecasts. Its 24/7 data will support NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center in protecting vital infrastructure, economic interests, and national security, both on Earth and in space.\nDavid McComas, professor, Princeton University, leads the IMAP mission with an international team of 25 partner institutions. The Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, built the spacecraft and operates the mission. NASA’s IMAP is the fifth mission in NASA’s Solar Terrestrial Probes program portfolio.

This will be followed by the Artemis III lunar landing mission in 2027, the first ever to the lunar South Pole region, which will launch an SLS with a crew of four aboard an Orion spacecraft to rendezvous with the Starship Human Landing System. These missions set the stage for NASA to land the first American on the Martian surface.\nTeams lifted the engine section onto a stand and mated the boat-tail to the bottom. They installed a canopy on top of the engine section to allow the segment to be air conditioned, preventing moisture build-up and contamination.\nTeams then lifted the completed assembly into High Bay 2 in the VAB where it will complete integration and check-out testing until the arrival of the rest of the Artemis III SLS core stage components to complete stage integration, targeted for Spring 2026.\nCalled the top four-fifths, the remaining elements of the core stage – the liquid hydrogen tank, liquid oxygen tank, intertank, and forward skirt – are at NASA’s Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans undergoing processing and integration. The four core stage RS-25 engines are scheduled to ship from NASA’s Stennis Space Center in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, in early 2026 for integration into the engine section.\nThe engine section is one of the most complex parts of the rocket, containing the four RS-25 engines and related ducts, valves, electronics, and more than 18 miles of cabling that connect to the core stage propellant tanks and rocket.\nThe move is part of a change to the SLS production process. The Artemis I and Artemis II SLS core stages were manufactured entirely at NASA Michoud and transferred to NASA Kennedy to be integrated with the SLS solid boosters, upper stage, and the Orion crew spacecraft. Beginning with the Artemis III hardware, NASA moved engine section internal outfitting and integration with the top of the core stage to NASA Kennedy to streamline the manufacturing process and enable simultaneous production operations of two core stages.\nTo learn more about Artemis, visit:"}

They simulated putting their spacesuits on and driving to the launch pad as well as emergency procedures they would use in the unlikely event of an emergency during the launch countdown requiring them to evacuate the launch pad.\nDuring the first nighttime scenario, the crew traversed the nine-mile journey from crew quarters to Launch Complex 39B. Once the crew arrived, teams declared a “scrub” and the astronauts headed back to crew quarters like they would in the event of their launch being postponed. The test ensures both the crew and ground teams at Kennedy are prepared and understand the timeline of their events for launch day. Practicing the scenario also complements a September 2023 daylight version of the test.\nOn August 12, teams completed an emergency egress system demonstration inside Kennedy’s Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB). The astronauts suited up and departed their crew quarters and headed to the VAB, where their Moon rocket is being assembled on the mobile launcher. Once inside, the crew went up the mobile launcher to the White Room in the crew access arm – the area where the crew enters and exits their Orion spacecraft.\nFrom there, teams went through different emergency scenarios with the astronauts, including practicing using emergency egress baskets while on the ground in the VAB.\nDuring a real emergency, personnel will use the baskets, which are suspended on a track cable that connects the mobile launcher to the perimeter of the pad.\nThe team then headed to the terminus area at Launch Complex 39B, the location at the perimeter of the launch pad where the baskets will come to a stop in the event of an emergency. Once there, armored emergency response vehicles drove the team away to a designated safe site locations at Kennedy.\nTeams will have another opportunity to practice different launch day scenarios with the Artemis II crew during a countdown demonstration test scheduled for later this year. Through the Artemis campaign, NASA will send astronauts to explore the Moon for scientific discovery, economic benefits, and to build the foundation for the first crewed missions to Mars – for the benefit of all."}

Trump at the White House Wednesday for the historic signing of the Executive Order (EO), “Enabling Competition in the Commercial Space Industry.”\n“People think the Department of Transportation (DOT) is just planes, trains, and automobiles – but we have a critical role to play in unlocking the final frontier. By slashing red tape tying up spaceport construction, streamlining launch licenses so they can occur at scale, and creating high-level space positions in government, we can unleash the next wave of innovation. At NASA, this means continuing to work with commercial space companies and improving our spaceports’ ability to launch,” said Duffy. “Thanks to the leadership of President Trump, we will enable American space competitiveness and superiority for decades to come. I look forward to leveraging my dual role at DOT and NASA to make this dream a reality.”\nThe EO will enable a competitive launch marketplace and substantially increase commercial space launch cadence and novel space activities by 2030.\n“The FAA strongly supports President Trump’s Executive Order to make sure the U.S. leads the growing space economy and continues to lead the world in space transportation and innovation,” said FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford. “This order safely removes regulatory barriers so that U.S. companies can dominate commercial space activities.”\nExecutive Order highlights:\nThe “Enabling Competition in the Commercial Space Industry” EO will help to:\n- Streamline commercial license and permit approvals for United States-based operators. This includes eliminating regulatory barriers and expediting environmental reviews for commercial launches and reentries.\n- Cut unnecessary red tape to make it easier to build new spaceports in the U.S. where more commercial space operations will be launched from. To ensure this Next Generation Spaceport Infrastructure, duplicate review process will be eliminated, and environmental reviews will be expedited.\n- Promote new space activities like in-space manufacturing and orbital refueling through a streamlined framework. Expediting and streamlining authorization for this Novel Space Activity is essential to American space competitiveness and superiority.\n- Establish a new position in the Office of the Secretary with the responsibility of advising the Secretary of Transportation on fostering innovation and deregulation in the commercial space industry.\n- The FAA’s associate administrator for Commercial Space Transportation also will be a senior executive non-career employee, and the Office of Space Commerce will be elevated into the Office of the Commerce Secretary.\n- Mitigate the risk of the United States losing its competitive edge in the commercial space industry by dismantling regulatory barriers that prevent rapid innovation and expansion.\nFor more information about the EO, visit:\n-end-\nBethany Stevens\nHeadquarters, Washington\n202-358-1600\nbethany.c.stevens@nasa.gov"}

The challenge aims to develop solutions for recycling common trash materials – like fabrics, plastics, foam, and metals – that could accumulate from activities such as system operations, industrial activities, and building habitats in deep space.\nPhase 2 of the LunaRecycle Challenge is divided into two levels: a milestone round and the final round. Submissions for the milestone round are open until January 2026, with finalists from that round announced in February. Up to 20 finalists from the milestone round will compete in the challenge’s in-person prototype demonstrations and final judging, slated for the following August. Cash prizes totaling $2 million are available for successful solutions in both rounds.\n“NASA is eager to see how reimagining these materials can be helpful to potential future planetary surface missions,” said Jennifer Edmunson, acting program manager for Centennial Challenges at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. “I’m confident focusing on the most critical trash items – and integration of the prototype and digital twin competition tracks – will yield remarkable solutions that could enable a sustainable human presence off-Earth and transform the future of space exploration.”\nEstimates indicate a crew of four astronauts could generate more than 2,100 kilograms (4,600 pounds) of single-use waste – including food packaging, plastic films, foam packaging, clothing, and more – within 365 days. Successful solutions in LunaRecycle’s Phase 2 should manage realistic trash volumes while minimizing resource inputs and crew time and operating safely with minimal hazards.\nPhase 2 is only open to U.S. individuals and teams. Participants can submit solutions regardless of whether they competed in the earlier Phase 1 competition.\nAll Phase 2 participants are expected to build a physical prototype. In addition, participants can submit a digital twin of their prototype for additional awards in the milestone and final rounds.\nThe LunaRecycle Challenge is a NASA Centennial Challenge, part of the Prizes, Challenges and Crowdsourcing Program within NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate. LunaRecycle Phase 1 received record-breaking interest from the global innovator community. The challenge received more than 1,200 registrations – more than any competition in the 20-year history of Centennial Challenges – and a panel of 50 judges evaluated nearly 200 submissions. Seventeen teams were selected as Phase 1 winners, representing five countries and nine U.S. states. Winners were announced via livestream on NASA Marshall’s YouTube channel.\nLunaRecycle is managed at NASA Marshall with subject matter experts primarily at the center, as well as NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida and NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley.

With spacecraft fueling complete, technicians moved Orion to the next facility on its path to the launch pad.\nTeams transported Orion from Kennedy’s Multi-Payload Processing Facility (MPPF) where it has been loaded with propellants for flight, to the Launch Abort System Facility (LASF). There, engineers with NASA’s Exploration Ground Systems Program will integrate the escape system atop the crew module.\nOrion arrived to the MPPF in May, where technicians fueled and processed Orion, loading propellants, high pressure gases, coolant, and other fluids necessary for the spacecraft and crew to carry out their 10-day journey around the Moon and back. The Artemis II crew also took part in multiple days of tests inside Orion in the MPPF, donning their Orion Crew Survival System spacesuits and entering their spacecraft to test all the equipment interfaces they will operate during the mission.\nNow inside the LASF, Orion will be integrated with its 44-foot-tall launch abort system, made up of two segments: the launch abort tower, including the abort, jettison, and attitude control motors; and the fairing assembly, including the ogive panels that protect the crew module and provide aerodynamic support during launch. The system is designed to carry the crew to safety in the event of an emergency atop the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket. Once integration is completed, the entire Orion stack will be transported to High Bay 3 in NASA Kennedy’s Vehicle Assembly Building where it will be connected to its Moon rocket.\nThe Artemis II test flight will send NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, and Christina Koch, and CSA (Canadian Space Agency) astronaut Jeremy Hansen around the Moon and return them safely back home. The mission is the first crewed flight under NASA’s Artemis campaign. Artemis will return Americans to the lunar surface and help the agency and its commercial and international partners prepare for future human missions to Mars."}

Teams aboard SpaceX recovery vessels retrieved the spacecraft and its crew. After returning to shore, the crew will fly to NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston and reunite with their families.\n“Splashdown! Crew-10 is back on Earth from the International Space Station marking the completion of another successful flight,” said NASA acting Administrator Sean Duffy. “Our crew missions are the building blocks for long-duration, human exploration pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. NASA is leading the way by setting a bold vision for exploration where we have a thriving space industry supporting private space stations in low Earth orbit, as well as humans exploring the Moon and Mars.”\nThe agency’s SpaceX Crew-10 mission lifted off at 7:03 p.m. on March 14, from Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. About 29 hours later, the crew’s SpaceX Dragon spacecraft docked to the Harmony module’s forward-facing port at 12:04 a.m. on March 16. Crew-10 undocked at 6:15 p.m. Aug. 8, to begin the trip home.\nDuring their mission, crew members traveled nearly 62,795,205 million miles and completed 2,368 orbits around Earth. The Crew-10 mission was the first spaceflight for Ayers and Peskov, and the second spaceflight for McClain and Onishi. McClain has logged 352 days in space over her two flights, and Onishi has logged 263 days in space during his flights.\nAlong the way, Crew-10 contributed hundreds of hours to scientific research, maintenance activities, and technology demonstrations. McClain, Ayers, and Onishi completed investigations on plant and microalgae growth, examined how space radiation affects DNA sequences in plants, observed how microgravity changes human eye structure and cells in the body, and more. The research conducted aboard the orbiting laboratory advances scientific knowledge and demonstrates new technologies that enable us to prepare for human exploration of the Moon and Mars.\nMcClain and Ayers also completed a spacewalk on May 1, relocating a communications antenna, beginning the installation of a mounting bracket for a future International Space Station Roll-Out Solar Array, and other tasks. It was the third spacewalk for McClain, the first for Ayers, and the 275th supporting space station assembly, maintenance, and upgrades.\nCrew-10’s return to Earth follows the Crew-11 mission, which docked to the station on Aug. 2 for its long-duration science expedition.\nNASA’s Commercial Crew Program provides reliable access to space, maximizing the use of the International Space Station for research and development, and supporting future missions beyond low Earth orbit, such as to the Moon and Mars, by partnering with private U.S. companies, including SpaceX, to transport astronauts to and from the space station.\nLearn more about NASA’s Commercial Crew Program at:\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/commercialcrew\n-end-\nJoshua Finch / Jimi Russell\nHeadquarters, Washington\n202-358-1100\njoshua.a.finch@nasa.gov / james.j.russell@nasa.gov\nSandra Jones / Joseph Zakrzewski\nJohnson Space Center, Houston\n281-483-5111\nsandra.p.jones@nasa.gov / joseph.a.zakrzewski@nasa.gov\nSteven Siceloff\nKennedy Space Center, Florida\n321-867-2468\nsteven.p.siceloff@nasa.gov"}

A graduate of the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School, he went on to serve as a test pilot before NASA selected him to become an astronaut in 2000.\n“Butch’s commitment to NASA’s mission and dedication to human space exploration is truly exemplary,” said Steve Koerner, acting director of NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. “His lasting legacy of fortitude will continue to impact and inspire the Johnson workforce, future explorers, and the nation for generations. On behalf of NASA’s Johnson Space Center, we thank Butch for his service.”\nDuring his time at NASA, Wilmore completed three missions launching aboard the space shuttle Atlantis, Roscosmos Soyuz, and Boeing Starliner to the International Space Station. Wilmore also returned to Earth aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft. Additionally, he conducted five spacewalks, totaling 32 hours outside the orbital laboratory.\n“Throughout his career, Butch has exemplified the technical excellence of what is required of an astronaut. His mastery of complex systems, coupled with his adaptability and steadfast commitment to NASA’s mission, has inspired us all,” said Joe Acaba, chief of the Astronaut Office at NASA Johnson. “As he steps into this new chapter, that same dedication will no doubt continue to show in whatever he decides to do next.”\nMost recently, Wilmore launched aboard Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft on June 5, 2024, for its first crewed flight test mission, arriving at the space station the following day. While aboard the station, Wilmore completed numerous tasks, including a spacewalk to help remove a radio frequency group antenna assembly from the station’s truss and collected samples and surface material for analysis from the Destiny laboratory and the Quest airlock.\n“From my earliest days, I have been captivated by the marvels of creation, looking upward with an insatiable curiosity. This curiosity propelled me into the skies, and eventually to space, where the magnificence of the cosmos mirrored the glory of its creator in ways words can scarcely convey,” said Wilmore. “Even as I ventured beyond Earth’s limits, I remained attuned to the beauty and significance of the world below, recognizing the same intricate design evident among the stars is also woven into the fabric of life at home.”\nLearn more about how NASA explores the unknown and innovates for the benefit of humanity at:\nCourtney Beasley\nJohnson Space Center, Houston\n281-910-4989"}

Quantum’s Ranger provides payload delivery service as a multi-mission spacecraft engineered for rapid maneuverability and adaptability, enabling multi-destination delivery for missions from low Earth orbit to lunar orbit.\nBlue Origin will produce two studies, including one for Blue Ring, a large, high-mobility space platform providing full-service payload delivery, on-board edge computing, hosting, and end-to-end mission operations. It uses hybrid solar-electric and chemical propulsion capability to reach geostationary, cislunar, Mars, and interplanetary destinations. The second is a New Glenn upper stage study.\nFirefly’s line of Elytra orbital vehicles offers on-demand payload delivery, imaging, long-haul communications, and domain awareness across cislunar space. Firefly’s Elytra Dark is equipped to serve as a transfer vehicle and enable ongoing operations in lunar orbit for more than five years.\nImpulse Space will produce two studies. The company provides in-space mobility with two vehicles, Mira and Helios. Mira is a high-thrust, highly maneuverable spacecraft for payload hosting and deployment, while Helios is a high-energy kick stage to rapidly deliver payloads from low Earth to medium Earth orbits, geostationary orbits and beyond.\nRocket Lab’s two studies will feature the upper stage of the company’s Neutron rocket, as well as a long-life orbital transfer vehicle based on its Explorer spacecraft. Both vehicles are equipped with their own propulsion systems and other subsystems for missions to medium Earth and geosynchronous orbit and deep space destinations like the Moon, Mars, and near-Earth asteroids.\nUnited Launch Alliance will assess the cislunar mission capabilities of an extended-duration Centaur V upper stage. Centaur would be capable of directly delivering multiple rideshare spacecraft to two different orbital destinations in cislunar space, avoiding the need for an additional rocket stage or orbital transfer vehicle.\nThe studies will be complete by mid-September. NASA will use the findings to inform mission design, planning, and commercial launch acquisition strategies for risk-tolerant payloads, with a possibility of expanding delivery services to larger-sized payloads and to less risk-tolerant missions in the future.\nNASA’s Launch Services Program selected providers through the agency’s VADR (Venture-Class Acquisition of Dedicated and Rideshare Launch Services) contract, which helps foster growth of the U.S. commercial launch market, enabling greater access to space at a lower cost for science and technology missions.\nFor more information about NASA’s Launch Services Program, visit:\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/launch-services-program\n-end-\nJosh Finch\nHeadquarters, Washington\n202-358-1100\njoshua.a.finch@nasa.gov\nLeejay Lockhart\nKennedy Space Center, Florida\n321-747-8310\nleejay.lockhart@nasa.gov"}

Crew donned their spacesuits July 31 and boarded Orion to train and experience some of the conditions they can expect on their mission.\nNASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, and Christina Koch, and CSA (Canadian Space Agency) astronaut Jeremy Hansen participated in a suited crew test and crew equipment interface test, performing launch day and simulated orbital activities inside Orion.\nEvery milestone in the Artemis campaign brings us closer to landing Americans back on the Moon and pushing onward to Mars.\nsEAN dUFFY\nacting NASA Administrator\n“In about six months, Artemis II astronauts will journey around the Moon for the first time in 53 years,” Duffy said. “America rallied behind Apollo because it represented the best of us – now it’s Artemis’ turn. They’re not just carrying a flag – they’re carrying the pride, power, and promise of the United States of America.”\nWith Orion powered on, the suited crew test was a close representation of what the crew can expect on launch day. The crew began the day by suiting up inside the spaceport’s Multi-Operation Support Building, donning their Orion crew survival system spacesuits, boarding the zero-emission crew transportation vehicles, and entering Orion, which is currently inside the Multi-Payload Processing Facility, where engineers have loaded its propellants over the course of several weeks.\nOnce in Orion, the crew performed several launch day activities, including communications checkouts and suit leak checks. For the first time, the crew was connected to the spacecraft and its communications and life control systems, and all umbilicals were connected while the spacecraft operated on full power.\nTeams simulated several different ground and flight conditions to give the crew more experience managing them in real time. Some of the activities simulated scenarios where the crew was challenged to address potential issues while in space such as leaks and failure of the air revitalization system fan, which is needed to provide oxygen and remove carbon dioxide from the cabin. Getting this hands-on experience and learning how to act fast to overcome potential challenges during flight helps ensure the crew is ready for any scenario.\nThe test provides astronauts the ability to train on the actual hardware they will use during flight, allowing them and support teams the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the equipment in configurations very close to what will be experienced during flight. It also allows teams to verify compatibility between the equipment and systems with flight controller procedures, so they can make any final adjustments ahead of launch.\nThis test brings together the Artemis II crew and the Orion spacecraft that will carry them to the Moon and back.\nShawn Quinn\nNASA's Exploration Ground Systems Program manager\n“It signifies the immense amount of work that our operations and development teams put into making sure we are ready for launch.” Quinn said. “They have meticulously planned each operation, timing them to perfection – and now we put it to the test.”\nExchanging their spacesuits for cleanroom garments for the crew equipment interface test, and with the spacecraft powered off, the crew also performed many of the activities they are likely to do in flight and conducted additional equipment checks. The crew practiced removing and stowing the foot pans on the pilot and commander seats, which will allow them to have more open space in the cabin after launch. They also accessed the stowage lockers and familiarized themselves with cameras, associated cables and mounts, and the environmental control and life support system hardware.\nIn addition to getting practical experience with the actual hardware they’ll use in space, they also prepared for life in deep space, reviewing cabin labels, sleep arrangements and checklists, and the hygiene bay.\nThrough the Artemis campaign, NASA will send astronauts to explore the Moon for scientific discovery, economic benefits, and to build the foundation for the first crewed missions to Mars – for the benefit of all."}

The company’s lunar lander is targeted to land at the Moon’s South Pole region in 2029.\nThis is Firefly’s fifth task order award and fourth lunar mission through CLPS. Firefly’s first delivery successfully landed on the Moon’s near side in March 2025 with 10 NASA payloads. The company’s second mission, targeting a launch in 2026, includes a lunar orbit drop-off of a satellite combined with a delivery to the lunar surface on the far side. Firefly’s third lunar mission will target landing in the Gruithuisen Domes on the near side of the Moon in 2028, delivering six experiments to study that enigmatic lunar volcanic terrain.\n“As NASA sends both humans and robots to further explore the Moon, CLPS deliveries to the lunar South Pole region will provide a better understanding of the exploration environment, accelerating progress toward establishing a long-term human presence on the Moon, as well as eventual human missions to Mars,” said Adam Schlesinger, manager of the CLPS initiative at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.\nThe rovers and instruments that are part of this newly awarded flight include:\n- MoonRanger is an autonomous microrover that will explore the lunar surface. MoonRanger will collect images and telemetry data while demonstrating autonomous capabilities for lunar polar exploration. Its onboard Neutron Spectrometer System instrument will study hydrogen-bearing volatiles and the composition of lunar regolith, or soil.\nLead development organizations: NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley, and Carnegie Mellon University and Astrobotic, both in Pittsburgh. - Stereo Cameras for Lunar Plume Surface Studies will use enhanced stereo imaging photogrammetry, active illumination, and ejecta impact detection sensors to capture the impact of the rocket exhaust plume on lunar regolith as the lander descends on the Moon’s surface. The high-resolution stereo images will help predict lunar regolith erosion and ejecta characteristics, as bigger, heavier spacecraft and hardware are delivered to the Moon near each other in the future.\nLead development organization: NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. - Laser Retroreflector Array is an array of eight retroreflectors on an aluminum support structure that enables precision laser ranging, a measurement of the distance between the orbiting or landing spacecraft to the reflector on the lander. The array is a passive optical instrument, which functions without power, and will serve as a permanent location marker on the Moon for decades to come.\nLead development organization: NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. - A CSA Rover is designed to access and explore remote South Pole areas of interest, including permanently shadowed regions, and to survive at least one lunar night. The CSA rover has stereo cameras, a neutron spectrometer, two imagers (visible to near-infrared), a radiation micro-dosimeter, and a NASA-contributed thermal imaging radiometer developed by the Applied Physics Laboratory. These instruments will advance our understanding of the physical and chemical properties of the lunar surface, the geological history of the Moon, and potential resources such as water ice. It will also improve our understanding of the environmental challenges that await future astronauts and their life support systems.\nLead development organization: CSA. - Laser Ionization Mass Spectrometer is a mass spectrometer that will analyze the element and isotope composition of lunar regolith. The instrument will utilize a Firefly-built robotic arm and Titanium shovel that will deploy to the lunar surface and support regolith excavation. The system will then funnel the sample into its collection unit and use a pulsed laser beam to identify differences in chemistry compared to samples studied in the past, like those collected during the Apollo program. Grain-by-grain analyses will provide a better understanding of the chemical complexity of the landing site and the surrounding area, offering insights into the evolution of the Moon.\nLead development organization: University of Bern in Switzerland.\nThrough the CLPS initiative, NASA purchases lunar landing and surface operations services from American companies. The agency uses CLPS to send scientific instruments and technology demonstrations to advance capabilities for science, exploration, or commercial development of the Moon, and to support human exploration beyond to Mars. By supporting a robust cadence of lunar deliveries, NASA will continue to enable a growing lunar economy while leveraging the entrepreneurial innovation of the commercial space industry.\nTo learn more about CLPS and Artemis, visit:\n-end-\nAlise Fisher\nHeadquarters, Washington\n202-358-2546\nalise.m.fisher@nasa.gov\nNilufar Ramji\nJohnson Space Center, Houston\n281-483-5111\nnilufar.ramji@nasa.gov"}

To ensure the tank functions properly and can safely flow the minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit super-cool liquid gas to the mobile launcher and SLS during launch countdown, the Artemis launch team successfully practiced flowing liquid hydrogen from both tanks to ensure there were no issues.\nOnce SLS and the Orion spacecraft are stacked, teams will roll the vehicle to the pad for a wet dress rehearsal, which will allow another opportunity to test the new hydrogen sphere prior to launch. This marks the completion of the final ground system verification and validation test for Artemis II. In the meantime, integrated testing with SLS and Orion continue inside Kennedy’s Vehicle Assembly Building prior to rolling out to the pad for launch."}

Designed to hold up to two astronauts, as well as operate remotely without a crew, this surface vehicle will enable NASA to achieve more of its science and exploration goals over a wide swath of lunar terrain.\n“The Artemis Lunar Terrain Vehicle will transport humanity farther than ever before across the lunar frontier on an epic journey of scientific exploration and discovery,” said Nicky Fox, associate administrator, Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “By combining the best of human and robotic exploration, the science instruments selected for the LTV will make discoveries that inform us about Earth’s nearest neighbor as well as benefit the health and safety of our astronauts and spacecraft on the Moon.”\nThe Artemis Infrared Reflectance and Emission Spectrometer (AIRES) will identify, quantify, and map lunar minerals and volatiles, which are materials that evaporate easily, like water, ammonia, or carbon dioxide. The instrument will capture spectral data overlaid on visible light images of both specific features of interest and broad panoramas to discover the distribution of minerals and volatiles across the Moon’s south polar region. The AIRES instrument team is led by Phil Christensen from Arizona State University in Tempe.\nThe Lunar Microwave Active-Passive Spectrometer (L-MAPS) will help define what is below the Moon’s surface and search for possible locations of ice. Containing both a spectrometer and a ground-penetrating radar, the instrument suite will measure temperature, density, and subsurface structures to more than 131 feet (40 meters) below the surface. The L-MAPS instrument team is led by Matthew Siegler from the University of Hawaii at Manoa.\nWhen combined, the data from the two instruments will paint a picture of the components of the lunar surface and subsurface to support human exploration and will uncover clues to the history of rocky worlds in our solar system. The instruments also will help scientists characterize the Moon’s resources, including what the Moon is made of, potential locations of ice, and how the Moon changes over time.\nIn addition to the instruments selected for integration onto the LTV, NASA also selected the Ultra-Compact Imaging Spectrometer for the Moon (UCIS-Moon) for a future orbital flight opportunity. The instrument will provide regional context to the discoveries made from the LTV. From above, UCIS-Moon will map the Moon’s geology and volatiles and measure how human activity affects those volatiles. The spectrometer also will help identify scientifically valuable areas for astronauts to collect lunar samples, while its wide-view images provide the overall context for where these samples will be collected. The UCIS-Moon instrument will provide the Moon’s highest spatial resolution data of surface lunar water, mineral makeup, and thermophysical properties. The UCIS-Moon instrument team is led by Abigail Fraeman from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.\n“Together, these three scientific instruments will make significant progress in answering key questions about what minerals and volatiles are present on and under the surface of the Moon,” said Joel Kearns, deputy associate administrator for Exploration, Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters. “With these instruments riding on the LTV and in orbit, we will be able to characterize the surface not only where astronauts explore, but also across the south polar region of the Moon, offering exciting opportunities for scientific discovery and exploration for years to come.”\nLeading up to these instrument selections, NASA has worked with all three lunar terrain vehicle vendors – Intuitive Machines, Lunar Outpost, and Venturi Astrolab – to complete their preliminary design reviews. This review demonstrates that the initial design of each commercial lunar rover meets all of NASA’s system requirements and shows that the correct design options have been selected, interfaces have been identified, and verification methods have been described. NASA will evaluate the task order proposals received from each LTV vendor and make a selection decision on the demonstration mission by the end of 2025.\nThrough Artemis, NASA will address high priority science questions, focusing on those that are best accomplished by on-site human explorers on and around the Moon by using robotic surface and orbiting systems. The Artemis missions will send astronauts to explore the Moon for scientific discovery, economic benefits, and build the foundation for the first crewed missions to Mars.\nTo learn more about Artemis, visit:\n-end-\nKaren Fox / Molly Wasser\nHeadquarters, Washington\n202-358-1600\nkaren.c.fox@nasa.gov / molly.l.wasser@nasa.gov"}

The team of scientists used the simulation to test how they will work together to lead lunar science activities during Artemis II and future crewed missions to the Moon.\nThe inaugural simulation marked a major milestone for Artemis science operations. Located in the Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center, the SER supports the mission’s main flight control room for lunar science and planetary observations. Built specifically for Artemis missions with these science priorities in mind, the SER is equipped to support rapid data interpretation, collaborative analysis, real-time decision making, and seamless coordination between the science and operations teams.\n“Embedding science directly into the mission operations environment ensures NASA can maximize Artemis discoveries,” said Kelsey Young, NASA’s Artemis II lunar science lead and lead science officer at the agency’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “Seeing the SER and collaborative teams function so beautifully after years of planning and testing makes me even more excited for the science we will accomplish when we return to the Moon.”\nArtemis II astronauts will observe the Moon during their 10-day mission around the Moon and back, taking photographs and verbally recording what they see. Their observations will support science objectives and provide data for potential landing sites for future Moon missions.\nWhile the team has run previous simulations, this was the first time they focused on lunar science and planetary observations in the actual rooms they will use during Artemis missions. This gave them the opportunity to test technologies, processes, and the setup of the science support rooms in a real-world scenario. The science team tested processes for prioritizing imaging targets, creating a timeline for observations, and processing incoming data in real time.\nThe SER’s innovative layout is designed to enhance collaboration and decision making. A large touchscreen table sits front and center in the room as the home base for the scrum team, a small group of scientists focused on making sure specific science objectives are met. Surrounding the scrum in a U-shape is the “trench,” home to experts in data visualization, geography, crew imagery, and timeline management. Behind the trench is a row for science operations support team leadership. First is the SER lead, who manages the activities of the room. Next is the SER Com, the sole person who communicates out of the room to the Science Officer in the Flight Control Room of Mission Control. Additional stations support the Crew Lunar Observations team and IT asset management.\nBeyond its technical capabilities, the SER also incorporates visual design elements meant to inspire. A bold blue line near the ceiling symbolizes Earth, while the room’s carpeting – patterned in gray, blue, and red – depicts a two-dimensional projection of the crystalline structure of anorthite, the Moon’s dominant mineral. Together, they give the sensation of standing on the Moon while looking back at Earth.\nThrough Artemis, NASA will send astronauts to explore the Moon for scientific discovery, economic benefits, and build the foundation for the first crewed missions to Mars."}

Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, a key milestone in the work being done to prepare for the next Americans to walk on the Moon.\nThis initial power on marked the startup of the crew module’s two vehicle management computers and six power and data units, which are responsible for commanding vehicle subsystems. The spacecraft will continue to undergo additional assessments throughout the summer including testing the display units, hand controllers, and audio systems that astronauts will use on their journey to the Moon. Once functional testing is complete, the crew module prop system will undergo proof pressure and leak testing. Proof pressure and leak tests ensure it can safely withstand the rigors of space.\nThe Artemis III service module, provided by ESA (European Space Agency), is also undergoing testing in the same facility. In May, engineers completed crew module adapter and environmental control and life support systems proof pressure and leak testing. Engineers expect to power on the service module’s avionics systems and controllers in the fall.\nFollowing initial power on of both the Artemis III crew module and service module, technicians will continue assembling the two elements and carry out additional testing, including thermal and acoustic tests, before the modules are connected in 2026.\nThis work to prepare for Artemis III continues as NASA moves closer to final preparations for Artemis II, the first crewed mission under Artemis, a 10-day journey by four astronauts around the Moon and back.

Technicians relocated the spacecraft May 5 from the Neil A. Armstrong Operations and Checkout Facility at the agency’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where it was assembled, to its fueling facility at the spaceport.\n“With the Artemis II mission on the horizon, seeing the Orion spacecraft depart the Operations and Checkout building for the Kennedy Space Center’s Multi-Payload Processing Facility reflects the many months of hard work, dedication, collaboration, and innovation of the entire team” said Howard Hu, NASA’s Orion program manager. “It demonstrates our ability to achieve ambitious goals to enable a safe and successful Artemis II mission. The Orion team was proud to turn over the first human-rated deep space exploration spacecraft in over 50 years to Exploration Ground Systems for fueling and stacking for our next mission to the Moon.”\nInside the Multi-Payload Processing Facility, engineers and technicians from NASA’s Exploration Ground Systems Program will load Orion’s propellants, high pressure gases, coolant, and other fluids the spacecraft and crew will need to maneuver and carry out their 10-day journey. Because of the hazardous nature of propellant loading, the spacecraft is fueled remotely from the spaceport’s Launch Control Center. After fueling is complete, the Artemis II crew will participate in an equipment interface test, in which they will don their Orion Crew Survival System spacesuits and enter the spacecraft to test all the equipment interfaces they will need to operate during the mission.\nFollowing servicing and final checkouts, the spacecraft will be transported to Kennedy’s Launch Abort System Facility to be integrated with its launch abort system, which is made up of abort, jettison, and attitude control motors and fairings. The system is designed to carry the crew to safety in the event of an emergency during launch or ascent atop the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket. Once completed, the spacecraft will be transported to the Vehicle Assembly Building to be stacked atop SLS.\nOrion’s relocation marks completion of a phase of assembly and testing work for Orion and the beginning of key steps toward launch and mission preparations. While in the operations and checkout facility, thousands of components in Orion’s systems were integrated into the spacecraft. The crew module, service module, and crew module adapter were connected, and vacuum and acoustics testing occurred to ensure the spacecraft will be able to endure the harsh environment of space.\nThe Artemis II test flight will take commander Reid Wiseman, pilot Victor Glover, and mission specialist Christina Koch from NASA, and mission specialist Jeremy Hansen from the CSA (Canadian Space Agency) around the Moon and return them safely back home.

The mobile launcher currently is under construction next to the spaceport’s iconic Vehicle Assembly Building.\nAssembled from innovative cast steel and outfitted with a range of equipment and utilities, teams integrated the modules and the growing launcher after the sections completed the journey from the mobile launcher 2 team’s module assembly yard. The 80 feet of height the modules added to mobile launcher now put the structure’s height at 276 feet, adding a new feature to the Kennedy skyline.\nModule 6 is designed to support the vehicle stabilizer, an interface that helps reduce motion of the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket during rollout to the launch pad, in high wind events, and during launch countdown. The stabilizer will drop away from the larger SLS Block 1 B rocket at liftoff and is designed to support future SLS configurations and their varying load requirements.\nModule 7 is the tower’s payload accommodation subsystem which will serve as the interface between SLS payloads and NASA Kennedy’s Launch Control Center, allowing the launch team to monitor, test, and issue commands to the SLS rocket and Orion flight hardware. Located within an air-conditioned steel shell and protected by launch-rated shock isolators, this subsystem also will provide payload access for personnel during pre- and post-launch operations.\nOnce complete, mobile launcher 2 will reach 390 feet and provide the support needed for the addition of the SLS Exploration Upper Stage for the Block 1B configuration of the rocket that will launch beginning with the Artemis IV mission.\nNASA and its partners are developing the foundational systems needed for long-term exploration at the Moon for the benefit of all as part of NASA’s Artemis campaign."}

As part of the agency’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative, Firefly’s Blue Ghost lunar lander delivered 10 NASA science and technology instruments to the Mare Crisium basin on the near side of the Moon. All NASA payloads have successfully powered on, collected science data, and operated on the surface of the Moon. Early Friday morning, Blue Ghost captured images of the lunar eclipse from the Moon.\nFirefly Aerospace\nOther NASA science highlights include:\n- The Lunar GNSS Receiver Experiment (LuGRE) acquired and tracked Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals, from satellite networks such as GPS and Galileo, in transit and on the surface of the Moon. This is the first time a navigation solution has been achieved using GNSS signals in lunar orbit and on the Moon.\n- The Lunar Environment heliospheric X-ray Imager (LEXI) captured a series of X-ray images to study the interaction of the solar wind and Earth’s magnetic field, providing insights into how space weather and other cosmic forces surrounding Earth affect the planet.\n- The Next Generation Lunar Retroreflector (NGLR) successfully reflected and returned laser light from two Lunar Laser Ranging Observatories, returning measurements that allow scientists to precisely measure the Moon’s shape and distance from Earth, expanding our understanding of the Moon’s inner structure.\n- The Lunar Magnetotelluric Sounder (LMS) was activated and successfully deployed five sensors to study the Moon’s interior by measuring electric and magnetic fields. The LMS instrument will allow scientists to characterize the interior of the Moon to depths up to 700 miles or more than halfway to the center of the Moon.\n- The Lunar Instrumentation for Subsurface Thermal Exploration with Rapidity (LISTER) is now the deepest robotic planetary subsurface thermal probe, reaching up to 3 feet (1 meter). Providing a first-of-its kind demonstration of robotic thermal measurements at varying depths, LISTER uses gas as the primary means of excavating (without conventional rotary or percussive drilling elements), as well as a coiled metal tube that straightens out and bores down in the hole created by the compressed gas.\n- The Stereo Cameras for Lunar Plume-Surface Studies (SCALPSS) instrument captured more than 3,000 images during the spacecraft’s lunar descent and touchdown on the Moon, providing insights into the effects engine plumes have on the surface. The SCALPSS payload also took hourly images the first couple of days after landing and was able to observe the shadows moving over the surface, which provided some additional data regarding the areas previously in shadow.\n- Lunar PlanetVac (LPV) was deployed on Blue Ghost’s surface access arm and successfully collected, transferred, and sorted lunar soil from the Moon using pressurized nitrogen gas, demonstrating a low-cost, low-mass solution for future robotic sample collection.\n- The Electrodynamic Dust Shield (EDS) successfully lifted and removed lunar regolith using electrodynamic forces on the glass and thermal radiator surfaces. These results demonstrate that EDS is a promising solution for dust mitigation on future lunar and interplanetary surface operations.\n- The Regolith Adherence Characterization (RAC) instrument examined how lunar regolith sticks to a range of materials exposed to the Moon’s environment, allowing the industry to better test, improve, and protect spacecraft, spacesuits, and habitats from abrasive lunar dust or regolith.\n- The Radiation Tolerant Computer (RadPC) successfully operated in transit, including through the Earth’s Van Allen Belts, and on the lunar surface, verifying solutions to mitigate radiation effects on computers that could make future missions safer and more cost effective.\nFollow along on NASA’s Artemis Blog and on Firefly’s Blue Ghost Mission page for additional updates."}

This fourth task order for Firefly will target landing in the Gruithuisen Domes on the near side of the Moon in 2028.\nAs part of the agency’s broader Artemis campaign, Firefly will deliver a group of science experiments and technology demonstrations under NASA’s CLPS initiative, or Commercial Lunar Payload Services, to these lunar domes, an area of ancient lava flows, to better understand planetary processes and evolution. Through CLPS, NASA is furthering our understanding of the Moon’s environment and helping prepare for future human missions to the lunar surface, as part of the agency’s Moon to Mars exploration approach.\n“The CLPS initiative carries out U.S. scientific and technical studies on the surface of the Moon by robot explorers. As NASA prepares for future human exploration of the Moon, the CLPS initiative continues to support a growing lunar economy with American companies,” said Joel Kearns, deputy associate administrator for exploration, Science Mission Directorate, NASA Headquarters in Washington. “Understanding the formation of the Gruithuisen Domes, as well as the ancient lava flows surrounding the landing site, will help the U.S. answer important questions about the lunar surface.”\nFirefly’s first lunar delivery is scheduled to launch no earlier than mid-January 2025 and will land near a volcanic feature called Mons Latreille within Mare Crisium, on the northeast quadrant of the Moon’s near side. Firefly’s second lunar mission includes two task orders: a lunar orbit drop-off of a satellite combined with a delivery to the lunar surface on the far side and a delivery of a lunar orbital calibration source, scheduled in 2026.\nThis new delivery in 2028 will send payloads to the Gruithuisen Domes and the nearby Sinus Viscositatus. The Gruithuisen Domes have long been suspected to be formed by a magma rich in silica, similar in composition to granite. Granitic rocks form easily on Earth due to plate tectonics and oceans of water. The Moon lacks these key ingredients, so lunar scientists have been left to wonder how these domes formed and evolved over time. For the first time, as part of this task order, NASA also has contracted to provide “mobility,” or roving, for some of the scientific instruments on the lunar surface after landing. This will enable new types of U.S. scientific investigations from CLPS.\n“Firefly will deliver six instruments to understand the landing site and surrounding vicinity,” said Chris Culbert, manager of the CLPS initiative at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. “These instruments will study geologic processes and lunar regolith, test solar cells, and characterize the neutron radiation environment, supplying invaluable information as NASA works to establish a long-term presence on the Moon.”\nThe instruments, collectively expected to be about 215 pounds (97 kilograms) in mass, include:\n- Lunar Vulkan Imaging and Spectroscopy Explorer, which consists of two stationary and three mobile instruments, will study rocks and regoliths on the summit of one of the domes to determine their origin and better understand geologic processes of early planetary bodies. The principal investigator is Dr. Kerri Donaldson Hanna of the University of Central Florida, Orlando.\n- Heimdall is a flexible camera system that will be used to take pictures of the landing site from above the horizon to the ground directly below the lander. The principal investigator is Dr. R. Aileen Yingst of the Planetary Science Institute, Tucson, Arizona.\n- Sample Acquisition, Morphology Filtering, and Probing of Lunar Regolith is a robotic arm that will collect samples of lunar regolith and use a robotic scoop to filter and isolate particles of different sizes. The sampling technology will use a flight spare from the Mars Exploration Rover project. The principal investigator is Sean Dougherty of Maxar Technologies, Westminster, Colorado.\n- Low-frequency Radio Observations from the Near Side Lunar Surface is designed to observe the Moon’s surface environment in radio frequencies, to determine whether natural and human-generated activity near the surface interferes with science. The project is headed up by Natchimuthuk Gopalswamy of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.\n- Photovoltaic Investigation on the Lunar Surface will carry a set of the latest solar cells for a technology demonstration of light-to-electricity power conversion for future missions. The experiment will also collect data on the electrical charging environment of the lunar surface using a small array of solar cells. The principal investigator is Jeremiah McNatt from NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland.\n- Neutron Measurements at the Lunar Surface is a neutron spectrometer that will characterize the surface neutron radiation environment, monitor hydrogen, and provide constraints on elemental composition. The principal investigator is Dr. Heidi Haviland of NASA’s Marshall Spaceflight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.\nThrough the CLPS initiative, NASA purchases lunar landing and surface operations services from American companies. The agency uses CLPS to send scientific instruments and technology demonstrations to advance capabilities for science, exploration, or commercial development of the Moon. By supporting a robust cadence of lunar deliveries, NASA will continue to enable a growing lunar economy while leveraging the entrepreneurial innovation of the commercial space industry. Two upcoming CLPS flights scheduled to launch in early 2025 will deliver NASA payloads to the Moon’s near side and south polar region, respectively.\nLearn more about CLPS and Artemis at:\n-end-\nAlise Fisher\nHeadquarters, Washington\n202-358-2546\nalise.m.fisher@nasa.gov\nNatalia Riusech / Nilufar Ramji\nJohnson Space Center, Houston\n281-483-5111\nnatalia.s.riusech@nasa.gov / nilufar.ramji@nasa.gov"}

Developed with input from a wide range of stakeholders, NASA’s Low Earth Orbit Microgravity Strategy will guide the agency toward the next generation of continuous human presence in orbit, enable greater economic growth, and maintain international partnerships.\n“As we near the retirement of the International Space Station in 2030, these objectives are a pivotal next step in solidifying U.S. leadership in space,” said NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy. “Our consultation with industry, academia, and international partners has helped refine a visionary roadmap for our future in low Earth orbit, which will be enabled by a continuous human presence. Together, we are ensuring that the benefits of exploring space continue to grow – advancing science, innovation, and opportunities for all, while preparing for humanity’s next giant leap of exploring the Moon, Mars and beyond.”\nIn early 2024, NASA initiated a planning process that included drafting an initial set of goals and objectives for the low Earth orbit microgravity environment and seeking feedback from its workforce, government partners, industry, academia, international space agencies, and the public. The agency reviewed more than 1,800 comments and hosted two workshops, resulting in essential adjustments to the goals and objectives to better align with its partners. The final framework includes 13 goals and 44 objectives across seven key areas: commercial low Earth orbit infrastructure, operations, science, research and technology development for exploration, international cooperation, workforce development and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) engagement, and public engagement.\nThe agency’s efforts in low Earth orbit are integral to its broader ambitions for deep space exploration. The microgravity environment in low Earth orbit provides a cost-effective, easily accessible proving ground for technologies and research necessary for human missions to explore the solar system. With most of the journey to Moon and Mars occurring in microgravity, the objectives give the opportunity to continue vital human research, test future exploration systems, and retain the critical skills needed to operate in the microgravity environment.\n“These finalized objectives represent a clear path forward as NASA transitions from the International Space Station to a new era of commercial space stations,” said Robyn Gatens, director of the International Space Station and acting director of commercial spaceflight. “Low Earth orbit will remain a hub for scientific discovery, technological advancement, and international cooperation, while making strategic investments in a commercial space ecosystem that benefits not just NASA, but the entire space community.”\nThe low Earth orbit microgravity goals and objectives, combined with significant stakeholder engagement, drive NASA’s need to maintain an unbroken, continuous heartbeat of humans in the commercial low Earth orbit destinations era. NASA requires long-duration flights to mitigate risk for future trips to the Red Planet. To ensure reliable access to and use of low Earth orbit, a diversity of providers operating on a regular cadence is essential. The objectives will also guide the development of requirements for future commercial space stations that will support NASA’s missions, while reducing risk for human missions to Mars, preserving operational skills, advancing critical scientific research, and sustaining engagement with international and commercial partners.\n“Collaboration and consultation remain a cornerstone of our low Earth orbit strategy,” said John Keefe, director of cross-agency strategy integration at NASA. “The objectives we’ve established will help NASA craft a work plan that ensures NASA is positioned to meet current and future needs and prioritizes the development of critical capabilities for low Earth orbit.”\nThe low Earth orbit microgravity goals and objectives are available online at:\n-end-\nAmber Jacobson\nHeadquarters, Washington\n202-358-1600\namber.c.jacobson@nasa.gov"}

The roadmap sets NASA on course for long-term lunar exploration under the Artemis campaign in preparation for future crewed missions to Mars.\nFollowing an Architecture Concept Review, the 2024 updates include a revision of NASA’s Architecture Definition Document which details technical approaches and processes of the agency’s exploration plans, an executive overview, and 12 new white papers on key Moon to Mars topics.\n“NASA’s Architecture Concept Review process is critical to getting us on a path to mount a human mission to Mars,” said NASA Associate Administrator Jim Free. “We’re taking a methodical approach to mapping out the decisions we need to make, understanding resource and technological trades, and ensuring we are listening to feedback from stakeholders.”\nOne newly released white paper highlights NASA’s decision to use fission power as the primary source of power on the Martian surface to sustain crews — the first of seven key decisions necessary for human Mars exploration. Fission power is a form of nuclear power unaffected by day and night cycles or potential dust storms on Mars.\nNew additions this year also include a broader, prioritized list of key architecture decisions that need to be made early in NASA’s plans to send humans to the Red Planet. Two new elements are now part of the agency’s Moon to Mars architecture — a lunar surface cargo lander and an initial lunar surface habitat. The lunar surface cargo lander will deliver logistics items, science and technology payloads, communications systems, and more. The initial surface habitat will house astronauts on the lunar surface to extend the crew size, range, and duration of exploration missions and enable crewed and uncrewed science opportunities.\nThe newest revision of the Architecture Definition Document adds more information about NASA’s decision road mapping process — how the agency decides which decisions must be made early in the planning process based on impacts to subsequent decisions — and a list of architecture-driven opportunities that help technology development organizations prioritize research into new technologies that will enable the Moon to Mars architecture.\n“Identifying and analyzing high-level architecture decisions are the first steps to realizing a crewed Mars exploration campaign,” said Catherine Koerner, associate administrator, Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate, NASA Headquarters in Washington. “Each yearly assessment cycle as part of our architecture process is moving us closer to ensuring we have a well thought out plan to accomplish our exploration objectives.”\nNASA’s Moon to Mars architecture approach incorporates feedback from U.S. industry, academia, international partners, and the NASA workforce. The agency typically releases a series of technical documents at the end of its annual analysis cycle, including an update of the Architecture Definition Document and white papers that elaborate on frequently raised topics.\nUnder NASA’s Artemis campaign, the agency will establish the foundation for long-term scientific exploration at the Moon, land the next Americans and first international partner astronaut on the lunar surface, and prepare for human expeditions to Mars for the benefit of all.\nFor NASA’s Moon to Mars architecture documents, visit:\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/moontomarsarchitecture\n-end-\nRachel Kraft / Kathryn Hambleton\nHeadquarters, Washington\n202-358-1600\nrachel.h.kraft@nasa.gov / kathryn.a.hambleton@nasa.gov"}

NASA investments have included projects that explore electrified aircraft technologies, and work that helped refine the electric short-takeoff and landing concept.\nThe agency’s work with private sector aviation providers helps NASA in its effort to bring sustainable solutions to the American public. In November, NASA selected Electra as one of five recipients of its Advanced Aircraft Concepts for Environmental Sustainability 2050 awards, through which they will develop design studies and explore key technologies to push the boundaries of possibility for next-generation sustainable commercial aircraft. These new studies will help the agency identify and select promising aircraft concepts and technologies for further investigations.\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/aeronautics\n-end-\nMeira Bernstein / Rob Margetta\nHeadquarters, Washington\n202-358-1600\nmeira.b.bernstein@nasa.gov / robert.j.margetta@nasa.gov"}

El jueves, la NASA anunció las últimas actualizaciones de sus planes de exploración lunar.\nUn grupo de expertos examinó los resultados de la investigación de la NASA sobre el escudo térmico de la nave Orion, tras haber sufrido una inesperada pérdida de material carbonizado en su reentrada en la atmósfera durante el vuelo de prueba sin tripulación Artemis I. Para el vuelo de prueba tripulado Artemis II, los ingenieros seguirán preparando a Orion con el escudo térmico ya montado en la cápsula.\nLa agencia también anunció que ahora apunta a abril de 2026 para el lanzamiento de Artemis II y a mediados de 2027 para Artemis III. Los plazos actualizados de las misiones también contemplan el tiempo necesario para abordar los sistemas de control medioambiental y de soporte vital de Orion.\n“La campaña Artemis es la iniciativa internacional más audaz, técnicamente desafiante y colaborativa que la humanidad se haya propuesto jamás”, dijo el administrador de la NASA, Bill Nelson. “Hemos logrado avances significativos en la campaña Artemis durante los últimos cuatro años, y estoy orgulloso del trabajo que nuestros equipos técnicos han hecho para prepararnos para este próximo paso adelante en la exploración, ya que buscamos aprender más sobre los sistemas de soporte vital de Orion para sustentar las operaciones de la tripulación durante Artemis II. Tenemos que hacer bien este próximo vuelo de prueba. Así es como la campaña Artemis triunfará”.\nLa decisión de la agencia se produce después de que una investigación exhaustiva de un problema con el escudo térmico de Artemis I demostrara que el escudo térmico de Artemis II es capaz de mantener a salvo a la tripulación durante la misión planeada con modificaciones en la trayectoria de Orion cuando entre en la atmósfera terrestre y reduzca su velocidad de unos 40.000 kilómetros por hora (casi 25.000 millas por hora) a unos 520 km/h (unas 325 mph) antes de que sus paracaídas se desplieguen para un amerizaje seguro en el océano Pacífico.\n“Durante todo nuestro proceso para investigar el fenómeno del escudo térmico y determinar un camino a seguir, nos hemos mantenido fieles a los valores fundamentales de la NASA; pusimos primero la seguridad y el análisis basado en datos”, dijo Catherine Koerner, administradora asociada de la Dirección de Misión de Desarrollo de Sistemas de Exploración en la sede de la NASA en Washington. “Las actualizaciones de nuestros planes de misión son un paso positivo para asegurar que podemos cumplir con seguridad nuestros objetivos en la Luna y desarrollar las tecnologías y capacidades necesarias para las misiones tripuladas a Marte.”\nLa NASA seguirá acoplando los componentes de su cohete Sistema de Lanzamiento Espacial o SLS (un proceso que comenzó en noviembre) y lo preparará para su integración con Orion para Artemis II.\nDurante el otoño boreal, la NASA, junto con un equipo de revisión independiente, estableció la causa técnica de un problema observado tras el vuelo de prueba sin tripulación Artemis I, en el que el material carbonizado del escudo térmico se desgastó de forma distinta a la esperada. Un análisis exhaustivo, que incluyó más de 100 pruebas en distintas instalaciones por todo el país, determinó que el escudo térmico de Artemis I no permitía evacuar suficientemente los gases generados en el interior de un material denominado Avcoat, lo que provocó que parte del material se agrietara y se desprendiera. El Avcoat está diseñado para desgastarse a medida que se calienta y es un material clave en el sistema de protección térmica que resguarda a Orion y a su tripulación de los casi 5.000 grados Fahrenheit de temperatura (2.760 grados Celsius) que se generan cuando Orion atraviesa la atmósfera terrestre al regresar de la Luna. Aunque durante Artemis I no había tripulación a bordo de Orion, los datos muestran que la temperatura en el interior de Orion hubiera sido agradable y segura de haber habido tripulación a bordo.\nLos equipos de ingeniería ya están ensamblando e integrando la nave Orion para Artemis III basándose en las lecciones aprendidas de Artemis I e implementando mejoras en la forma de fabricar los escudos térmicos para los retornos de las misiones tripuladas de alunizaje con el fin de lograr uniformidad y permeabilidad constante. La reentrada atmosférica doble (“skip entry”) es necesaria para el retorno desde las velocidades previstas para las misiones de alunizaje.\n“Victor, Christina, Jeremy y yo hemos estado siguiendo todos los aspectos de esta decisión y estamos agradecidos por la disposición de la NASA a sopesar todas las opciones y tomar decisiones en el mejor interés de los vuelos espaciales tripulados. Estamos entusiasmados por volar con la misión Artemis II y seguir allanando el camino para la exploración humana continua de la Luna y Marte”, declaró Reid Wiseman, astronauta de la NASA y comandante de Artemis II. “Hace poco estuvimos en el Centro Espacial Kennedy de la agencia en Florida y pudimos ver los propulsores de nuestro cohete SLS, la etapa central y la nave Orion. Es inspirador ver la escala de este esfuerzo, conocer a las personas que trabajan en esta máquina, y no podemos esperar a hacerla volar a la Luna”.\nWiseman, junto con los astronautas de la NASA Victor Glover y Christina Koch y el astronauta de la CSA (Agencia Espacial Canadiense) Jeremy Hansen, volarán a bordo del vuelo de prueba Artemis II, de 10 días de duración, alrededor de la Luna y de regreso. El vuelo proporcionará datos valiosos sobre los sistemas de Orion necesarios para sustentar a la tripulación en su viaje al espacio profundo y traerlos sanos y salvos de vuelta a casa, incluyendo la renovación del aire en la cabina, las funciones de vuelo manual y cómo interactúan los humanos con el resto del hardware y software de la nave espacial.\nCon Artemis, la NASA explorará más de la Luna que nunca, aprenderá a vivir y trabajar más lejos de nuestro hogar y se preparará para la futura exploración humana del planeta rojo. El SLS de la NASA, los sistemas terrestres de exploración y la nave Orion, junto con el sistema de aterrizaje para seres humanos, los trajes espaciales de nueva generación, la estación espacial lunar Gateway y los futuros vehículos exploradores son los cimientos de la NASA para la exploración del espacio profundo.\nPara más información sobre Artemis (en inglés), visita:\n-fin-\nMeira Bernstein / Rachel Kraft / María José Viñas\nSede, Washington\n202-358-1600\nmeira.b.bernstein@nasa.gov / rachel.h.kraft@nasa.gov / maria-jose.vinasgarcia@nasa.gov"}

On Thursday, NASA announced the latest updates to its lunar exploration plans.\nExperts discussed results of NASA’s investigation into its Orion spacecraft heat shield after it experienced an unexpected loss of charred material during re-entry of the Artemis I uncrewed test flight. For the Artemis II crewed test flight, engineers will continue to prepare Orion with the heat shield already attached to the capsule. The agency also announced it is now targeting April 2026 for Artemis II and mid-2027 for Artemis III. The updated mission timelines also reflect time to address the Orion environmental control and life support systems.\n“The Artemis campaign is the most daring, technically challenging, collaborative, international endeavor humanity has ever set out to do,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “We have made significant progress on the Artemis campaign over the past four years, and I’m proud of the work our teams have done to prepare us for this next step forward in exploration as we look to learn more about Orion’s life support systems to sustain crew operations during Artemis II. We need to get this next test flight right. That’s how the Artemis campaign succeeds.”\nThe agency’s decision comes after an extensive investigation of an Artemis I heat shield issue showed the Artemis II heat shield can keep the crew safe during the planned mission with changes to Orion’s trajectory as it enters Earth’s atmosphere and slows from nearly 25,000 mph to about 325 mph before its parachutes unfurl for safe splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.\n“Throughout our process to investigate the heat shield phenomenon and determine a forward path, we’ve stayed true to NASA’s core values; safety and data-driven analysis remained at the forefront,” said Catherine Koerner, associate administrator, Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “The updates to our mission plans are a positive step toward ensuring we can safely accomplish our objectives at the Moon and develop the technologies and capabilities needed for crewed Mars missions.”\nNASA will continue stacking its SLS (Space Launch System) rocket elements, which began in November, and prepare it for integration with Orion for Artemis II.\nThroughout the fall months, NASA, along with an independent review team, established the technical cause of an issue seen after the uncrewed Artemis I test flight in which charred material on the heat shield wore away differently than expected. Extensive analysis, including from more than 100 tests at unique facilities across the country, determined the heat shield on Artemis I did not allow for enough of the gases generated inside a material called Avcoat to escape, which caused some of the material to crack and break off. Avcoat is designed to wear away as it heats up and is a key material in the thermal protection system that guards Orion and its crew from the nearly 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit of temperatures that are generated when Orion returns from the Moon through Earth’s atmosphere. Although a crew was not inside Orion during Artemis I, data shows the temperature inside Orion remained comfortable and safe had crew been aboard.\nEngineers already are assembling and integrating the Orion spacecraft for Artemis III based on lessons learned from Artemis I and implementing enhancements to how heat shields for crewed returns from lunar landing missions are manufactured to achieve uniformity and consistent permeability. The skip entry is needed for return from speeds expected for lunar landing missions.\n“Victor, Christina, Jeremy, and I have been following every aspect of this decision and we are thankful for the openness of NASA to weigh all options and make decisions in the best interest of human spaceflight. We are excited to fly Artemis II and continue paving the way for sustained human exploration of the Moon and Mars,” said Reid Wiseman, NASA astronaut and Artemis II commander. “We were at the agency’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida recently and put eyes on our SLS rocket boosters, the core stage, and the Orion spacecraft. It is inspiring to see the scale of this effort, to meet the people working on this machine, and we can’t wait to fly it to the Moon.”\nWiseman, along with NASA astronauts Victor Glover and Christina Koch and CSA (Canadian Space Agency) astronaut Jeremy Hansen, will fly aboard the 10-day Artemis II test flight around the Moon and back. The flight will provide valuable data about Orion systems needed to support crew on their journey to deep space and bring them safely home, including air revitalization in the cabin, manual flying capabilities, and how humans interact with other hardware and software in the spacecraft.\nWith Artemis, NASA will explore more of the Moon than ever before, learn how to live and work farther away from home, and prepare for future human exploration of the Red Planet. NASA’s SLS, exploration ground systems, and Orion spacecraft, along with the human landing system, next-generation spacesuits, Gateway lunar space station, and future rovers are NASA’s foundation for deep space exploration.\nFor more information about Artemis, visit:\n-end-\nMeira Bernstein / Rachel Kraft\nHeadquarters, Washington\n202-358-1600\nmeira.b.bernstein@nasa.gov / rachel.h.kraft@nasa.gov"}
